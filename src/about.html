            <h2>Dropout Prevention Data</h2>
            <p>Save the Children work toward securing education for all children. <br>A challenge is that many children drop out of school around the world,
                <br> especially in african countries.<a href="https://www.savethechildren.net/node/702">Save the Children</a> receives a lot of data, <br> and our mission is to help Save the Children analyze and understand
                <br> this data, so they can use the data to prevent children from dropping out <br> of school.
                <br>Our solution to this problem is a platform we call HDX <br> (Humanitarian Data Exchange). The Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX)
                <br> is an open platform for sharing humanitarian data. We want to add <br> geographical data to the attendance and enrollment data in developing
                <br> countries.
                Combining this new data set with other geographical <br> humanitarian data shared on the HDX (Humanitarian Data Exchange)
                <br> will enable Save the Children to detect and understand underlying social <br> and economic problems contributing to children dropping out.
                An example <br> of this would be to cross-reference data on food price and availability, <br> with attendance data for students from a given region.
                <br>This would make it possible to intervene earlier to ensure continued <br> enrollment and attendance. The use of HDX-data will be facilitated by
                <br> the HDX Python API, which makes it possible to both use and add data to the HDX-database.

        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>This project originated from an innovation camp held at OsloMet university. We are a computer science student group that was posed with the question on how to help Save the children with the challenges they face. One of these challenges is that Save the Children gets a lot of data, but they don't know how to use it efficiently. We tried to come up with innovative solutions to this question, and on this page you will find information about our solution.
            <br> <br> This webpage is made by Johan Koffi Sereba and Anders Eddie Jacobsen.
            <br> <br>The student group consist of Mai-Lise Markeng, Manroop Kaur, Knut HÃ¸ie Guettler, Omar Massfih, Daniel Westgaard, Enes Ergin, Tobias Hermansson Mordt, Fredrik Solbakken Risborg, Hassan Shaltouh, Linn Hofseide, Alexander Aho, Johan Hansen, Johan Koffi Sereba, Thomas Kvam, Piotr Pajchel, Fatima Yasefi, Danial Dutt, Medeina Bagociute, Anders Eddie Jacobsen, Christian Myklebust, Rebecca Weiby Friden.
            The student mentor of the group was Mohammed Khir Harate.
